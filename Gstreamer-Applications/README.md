# Gstreamer Applications

The purpose of these samples is helping users to learn how to implement the functions of gstreamer on the Qualcomm platform.  These samples include 

+ Camera display
+ Video encoding and decoding
+ Audio recording and playback 
+ Video streaming
+ Video transform
+ GUI application
+ Gst AlsaPlugin
+ Gst TFlite

## Get Started

### Install Qt

GUI application is a Qt application. Some Qt packages are needed.
Login to Qualcomm Robotics RB5 dev kit using  adb shell 

```bash
apt install qt5-default qtwayland5 qtbase5-private-dev
```

To display USB camera, v4l2-ctl is a useful tool to list the device files of the camera. It can be installed from v4l-utils pacakge.

```bash
$ adb shell
$ apt install v4l-utils
```

### Download

Download and extract source code to /data/gstreamer-applications/ on board.
```
$ adb shell
$ cd /data
$ git clone https://github.com/quic/sample-apps-for-Qualcomm-Robotics-RB5-platform.git
```
Please make sure that the development kit has network connection over Wi-Fi or Ethernet.

### Compile

GUI application is a Qt application. It needs to run ```qmake``` to generate Makefile before ```make```. 

Other samples can use ```make``` to compile directly.

```bash
$ cd /data/Gstreamer-Applications
$ cd gst_gui_app/
$ qmake
$ cd ..
$ make
```

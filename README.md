# Sample applications for robotics platforms

This is a repository of samples application that can run on the following development kits:

 - Qualcomm® Robotics RB5 dev kit based on the Qualcomm® QRB5165 processor
 - Qualcomm® Robotics RB2 dev kit based on the Qualcomm® QRB4210 processor
 - Qualcomm® Robotics RB1 dev kit based on the Qualcomm® QRB2210 processor 


Before we jump into the sample apps, lets take a brief look at the supported operating systems available for these development kits.

The development kits support two types of Linux based operating system images. First is the “LE” version, second is the “UBUN” version that has an Ubuntu-based Rootfs. Both types of system images are built using the Yocto build system. For the most part both options are designed to have feature parity, but at a high-level Ubuntu-based system images will support an apt-get package manager and on device compilation, whereas the "LE" version does not come with a package manager and apps will need to be built off-target using the SDK toolchain.

  

The system image is a combination of multiple subsystem binaries for the application processor and various DSPs available on the applicable chipsets. Below are some example system images that can be generated using SDK manager from Thundercomm.

  

 - QRB5165.LE.1.0-xxxxxx : System image based on Linux Kernel 4.xx for RB5 dev kit
 - QRB5165.UBUN.1.0-xxxxxx : System image based on Linux Kernel 4.xx and ubuntu based rootfs for RB5 dev kit
 - QRB5165.UBUN.2.0-xxxxxx : System image based on Linux Kernel 5.xx and ubuntu based rootfs for RB5 dev kit

  
  

Since the underlying system images running on these development kits might be based on different versions of Linux kernel, the sample apps in this repository are also organized to help developers run the right apps on the applicable platform. Below is a high level folder structure for the sample apps.
 

| Platform | Processor | Linux Kernel | Folder |
|--|--|--|--|
| Qualcomm® Robotics RB5 dev kit |QRB5165 | 4.x | /RB5/linux_kernel_4_x |
| Qualcomm® Robotics RB5 dev kit |QRB5165 | 5.x | /RB5/linux_kernel_5_x |
| Qualcomm® Robotics RB1 and RB2 dev kits | QRB4210 / QRB2210 | 5.x | /RB1RB2/ |

  
  
  
Below is an overview on how sample apps are categorized. Each sample application has its own folder within the category.  Please follow the README in the respective folders to build, deploy and test.

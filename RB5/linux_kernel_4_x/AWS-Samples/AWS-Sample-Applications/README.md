    iv. Choose Download .csv file and make sure to store the keys in a secure location, as you will not have access to the secret access key again after this dialog box closes

    Secret access key: _wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY_
    ```
    v. Configure AWS CLI in Qualcomm Robotics RB5
    - aws configure command is the fastest way to set up AWS CLI installation.
    Open a terminal in Qualcomm Robotics RB5 and enter the command below
    ```
    $ aws configure 
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE 
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY 
    Default region name [None]: us-west-2-example
